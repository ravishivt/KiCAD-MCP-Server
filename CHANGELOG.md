# Changelog

All notable changes to the KiCAD MCP Server project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### New MCP Tools

- `set_schematic_component_property` — Add or update a single custom property
  (BOM / sourcing field) on a placed schematic symbol. Convenience wrapper
  around `edit_schematic_component` for the common case of attaching one MPN /
  Manufacturer / DigiKey_PN / LCSC / JLCPCB_PN / Voltage / Tolerance /
  Dielectric value at a time. Newly created properties default to hidden so
  they do not clutter the schematic canvas.

- `remove_schematic_component_property` — Delete a custom property from a
  placed schematic symbol. The four built-in fields (Reference, Value,
  Footprint, Datasheet) are protected and cannot be removed; clear them by
  setting their value to `""` via `edit_schematic_component` instead.

### Tool Enhancements

- `edit_schematic_component`: extended with two new optional parameters that
  promote arbitrary custom properties to first-class citizens:
  - **`properties`** — map of property name to either a string value or a full
    spec object `{ value, x?, y?, angle?, hide?, fontSize? }`. Adds the
    property if it does not yet exist on the symbol, otherwise updates the
    existing value (and optionally its label position / visibility). Lets a
    single tool call attach an entire BOM / sourcing payload to a component:
    `properties: { MPN: "RC0603FR-0710KL", Manufacturer: "Yageo", Tolerance: "1%" }`.
  - **`removeProperties`** — list of custom property names to delete in the
    same call.
  - String values written through any of the property paths are now properly
    backslash-escaped so descriptions containing `"` or `\` no longer
    corrupt the .kicad_sch file.

- `get_schematic_component`: clarified description — it already returns every
  field on the symbol (built-in + custom). The tool description now spells
  this out explicitly so agents know they can use it to inspect MPN,
  Manufacturer, Distributor PN and other BOM fields without a separate call.

### New MCP Prompt

- `component_sourcing_properties` — Guides the LLM through attaching BOM and
  sourcing metadata (MPN, Manufacturer, distributor part numbers, parametric
  fields like Voltage / Tolerance / Dielectric) to schematic components. Lists
  the conventional property names recognised by downstream BOM tooling and the
  recommended call sequence (`list_schematic_components` →
  `get_schematic_component` → `set_schematic_component_property` /
  `edit_schematic_component`).

### Tests

- `tests/test_schematic_component_properties.py`: 32 new tests covering custom
  property add / update / remove (single + batched), full spec dicts, position
  defaults, `(hide yes)` defaulting, protected built-in field rejection,
  no-op removal, special-character escaping, UUID preservation, and the two
  new convenience tools.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-03-11

### Merged: PR #57 (Kletternaut/demo/rpiCSI-videotest → main)

This release incorporates 28 commits developed and live-tested during a full
Raspberry Pi CSI adapter PCB design session. All tools listed below were validated
end-to-end using Claude Desktop + KiCAD 9 on Windows.

### New MCP Tools

- `connect_passthrough` — Schematic-only tool that wires all pins of one connector
  directly to the matching pins of another (e.g. J1 pin N → J2 pin N). Creates nets
  named with a configurable prefix (`netPrefix`). Designed for FFC/ribbon cable
  passthrough adapters. **Schematic only — do not call for PCB routing.**

- `sync_schematic_to_board` — Imports all net/pad assignments from the schematic
  into the open PCB file. Required after `connect_passthrough` before routing can
  start. Returns `pads_assigned` count for verification.

- `snapshot_project` — Saves a named checkpoint of the entire project folder into a
  `snapshots/` subdirectory inside the project. Allows resuming from a known-good
  state without redoing earlier steps. Accepts `step`, `label`, and optional `prompt`
  parameters.

- `run_erc` — Runs KiCAD's Electrical Rules Check on the schematic and returns
  violations as structured JSON.

- `import_svg_logo` — Converts an SVG file to PCB silkscreen polygons and places
  them on a specified layer.

### Bug Fixes

- `route_pad_to_pad`: **Critical fix for B.Cu footprints in KiCAD 9.** `pad.GetLayerName()`
  always returned `F.Cu` for SMD pads on flipped footprints (KiCAD 9 SWIG bug).
  Fix: use `footprint.GetLayer()` instead, which correctly reflects the placed layer
  after `Flip()`. Without this fix, no vias were inserted for back-to-back connectors.

- `route_pad_to_pad`: Via was placed at the geometric midpoint between the two pads.
  For back-to-back mirrored connectors (J1 F.Cu / J2 B.Cu) this caused all 15 vias
  to stack at the same X coordinate (board center). Fix: via is now placed at the
  X coordinate of the start pad (`via_x = start_pos.x`), producing 15 parallel
  vertical traces.

- `place_component` (B.Cu footprints): `Flip()` was called before `board.Add()`,
  causing KiCAD 9 to hang for ~30 seconds. Fix: `board.Add()` first, then `Flip()`.

- `add_board_outline`: Three separate bugs fixed — incorrect cornerRadius fallback,
  wrong top-left origin default, and broken arc delegation for IPC rounded rectangles.

- `snapshot_project`: Snapshots were saved one level above the project directory,
  cluttering the parent folder. Fix: snapshots now go into `<project>/snapshots/`.

- MCP server log timestamp was always UTC/ISO. Fix: now uses local system time.

- `search_tools` (router pattern): direct tools like `snapshot_project` were invisible
  to the router. Fix: direct tool names added to the router's known-tool list.

### Developer Mode (`KICAD_MCP_DEV=1`)

Set the environment variable `KICAD_MCP_DEV=1` in your Claude Desktop config to
enable developer features:

```json
"env": {
  "KICAD_MCP_DEV": "1"
}
```

**What it does:**

- `export_gerber` automatically copies the current MCP session log into the project's
  `logs/` subdirectory as `mcp_log_<timestamp>.txt`.
- `snapshot_project` copies the MCP session log into `logs/` at every checkpoint as
  `mcp_log_step<N>_<timestamp>.txt`.
- If a `prompt` parameter is passed to `snapshot_project`, it is saved as
  `PROMPT_step<N>_<timestamp>.md` alongside the log.

**Purpose:** Makes it easy to include the full tool call history when filing a bug
report or GitHub issue — just attach the log file from the project's `logs/` folder.

> ⚠️ **Privacy warning:** The MCP session log contains the **complete conversation
> history** between Claude and the MCP server, including all tool parameters and
> responses. When sharing a project directory (e.g. as a ZIP attachment in a GitHub
> issue), **review or delete the `logs/` folder first** to avoid accidentally
> disclosing sensitive file paths, component names, or design details.

### Snapshot Logging (always active)

Regardless of dev mode, `snapshot_project` now always saves a copy of the current
MCP session log into `<project>/logs/` at each checkpoint. This means every project
automatically retains a traceable record of which tools were called and in what order.

> ⚠️ **Same privacy note applies:** the `logs/` directory inside your project folder
> contains tool call history. Do not share it publicly without reviewing its contents.

## [2.2.2-alpha] - 2026-03-01

### New MCP Tools

- `route_pad_to_pad` – Convenience wrapper around `route_trace` that looks up pad positions
  automatically. Accepts `fromRef`/`fromPad`/`toRef`/`toPad` instead of raw XY coordinates.
  Auto-detects net from pad assignment (overridable via `net` param). Saves ~2 tool calls per
  connection (~64 calls for a full TMC2209 board compared to the 3-step get_pad_position flow).
  Live tested: ESP32 ↔ TMC2209 STEP/DIR traces routed without prior coordinate lookup. ✅

- `copy_routing_pattern` – Now registered as MCP tool in TypeScript layer (`routing.ts`).
  Was previously implemented in Python but missing from the MCP tool registry.
  Parameters: `sourceRefs`, `targetRefs`, `includeVias?`, `traceWidth?`.

### Bug Fixes

- `add_schematic_component` / `DynamicSymbolLoader`: ignored project-local `sym-lib-table`.
  `find_library_file()` only searched global KiCAD install directories, causing "library not
  found" errors for any symbol in a project-local `.kicad_sym` file. Fix: added `project_path`
  parameter; reads project `sym-lib-table` first via new `_resolve_library_from_table()` helper
  before falling back to global dirs. `project_path` is auto-derived from the schematic path.

- `place_component`: ignored project-local `fp-lib-table`. `FootprintLibraryManager` was
  initialised once at server start without a project path, so self-created `.kicad_mod`
  footprints were never found. Fix: new `boardPath` parameter in TypeScript + Python;
  `_handle_place_component` wrapper recreates `FootprintLibraryManager(project_path=…)` whenever
  the active project changes (cached to avoid redundant recreation).

- `copy_routing_pattern`: copied 0 traces when pads had no net assignments. The filter
  `track.GetNetname() in source_nets` always returned empty when pads were placed without net
  assignment. Fix: geometric fallback using bounding box of source footprint pads ±5mm
  tolerance. Response includes `filterMethod` field indicating which mode was used
  (`"net-based"` or `"geometric (pads have no nets)"`).

- `template_with_symbols.kicad_sch`, `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`: restored
  format version `20250114` (KiCAD 9) after upstream commit `2b38796` accidentally downgraded
  both files to `20240101`. KiCAD 9 rejects schematics with outdated version numbers.

- **CRITICAL: `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`**: removed 7 invalid `;;` comment
  lines introduced by upstream commit `b98c94b`. KiCAD's S-expression parser does not support
  any comment syntax — it expects every non-empty, non-whitespace line to start with `(`.
  The comments (`;; PASSIVES`, `;; SEMICONDUCTORS`, `;; INTEGRATED CIRCUITS`, `;; CONNECTORS`,
  `;; POWER/REGULATORS`, `;; MISC`, `;; TEMPLATE INSTANCES (...)`) caused KiCAD 9 to reject
  every schematic created from this template with a hard parse error:

  > `Expecting '(' in <file>.kicad_sch, line 8, offset 5`
  > **Action required for existing projects:** delete every line beginning with `;;` from any
  > `.kicad_sch` file created between upstream commit `b98c94b` and this fix.

- `add_schematic_component` / `inject_symbol_into_schematic`: symbol definition in
  `lib_symbols` was never refreshed after editing via `create_symbol` / `edit_symbol`.
  If the symbol was already present in the schematic's embedded `lib_symbols` section,
  the function returned immediately — `delete + re-add` still pulled in the stale cached
  definition. Fix: always read the current definition from the `.kicad_sym` file; if a
  stale entry exists in `lib_symbols`, remove it first, then inject the fresh one.
  Verified live. ✅

- `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`: removed 13 legacy `_TEMPLATE_*` offscreen
  instances (`_TEMPLATE_R`, `_TEMPLATE_C`, `_TEMPLATE_U`, etc.) that were placed at
  `x=-100` as clone-sources for the old `ComponentManager` approach. `DynamicSymbolLoader`
  (the current implementation) injects symbols directly and never needs these placeholders.
  They appeared as dangling reference designators in KiCAD's component navigator and in
  the schematic canvas when zoomed far out.

### Maintenance

- `.gitignore`: added `*.kicad_pcb.bak`, `*.kicad_pro.bak` alongside existing `-bak` variants;
  consolidated personal/local files under `myContribution/`.

---

## [2.2.1-alpha] - 2026-02-28

### New MCP Tools

- `edit_schematic_component` – Update properties of a placed symbol in-place (footprint,
  value, reference rename). More efficient than delete + re-add: preserves position and UUID.

### Bug Fixes

- `add_schematic_component`: `footprint` parameter was accepted but silently ignored – the
  value was never passed through to `DynamicSymbolLoader.add_component()` /
  `create_component_instance()`. All newly placed symbols always had an empty Footprint
  field. Fix: added `footprint: str = ""` to both functions and threaded it through every
  call site including the TypeScript tool schema.

- `delete_schematic_component`: only deleted the first matching instance when duplicate
  references existed (e.g. after an aborted add attempt). Root cause: loop used `break`
  after the first match. Fix: collect all matching blocks first, then delete them all back-
  to-front (to preserve line indices). Response now includes `deleted_count`.

- `templates/*.kicad_sch`, `project.py`, `schematic.py`: Update KiCAD schematic format
  version from `20230121` (KiCAD 7) to `20250114` (KiCAD 9). The MCP server targets
  KiCAD 9 exclusively (`pcbnew.pyd` compiled for KiCAD 9.0, Python 3.11.5) – generating
  files in an outdated format caused a spurious "This file was created with an older
  KiCAD version" warning on every newly created schematic.

- `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`: Remove 13 corrupt `_TEMPLATE_*` placed-symbol
  blocks with `(lib_id -100)` – an integer caused by old sexpdata serializer (same bug
  PR #40 fixed for the add path). KiCAD crashed with a null-pointer when selecting these
  symbols. They appeared as grey `_TEMPLATE_R?`, `_TEMPLATE_U_REG?` etc. labels far
  outside the sheet boundary (~5000mm off-sheet).

  **Discovered via:** live testing on a real JLCPCB/KiCAD 9 project.
  **Affected users:** schematics created from this template before this fix contain the
  same corrupt blocks – remove all `(symbol (lib_id -100) ...)` blocks whose Reference
  starts with `_TEMPLATE_`.

## [2.2.0-alpha] - 2026-02-27

### New MCP Tools (TypeScript layer – previously Python-only)

**Routing tools:**

- `delete_trace` - Delete traces by UUID, position or net name
- `query_traces` - Query/filter traces on the board
- `get_nets_list` - List all nets with net code and class
- `modify_trace` - Modify trace width or layer
- `create_netclass` - Create or update a net class
- `route_differential_pair` - Route a differential pair between two points
- `refill_zones` - Refill all copper zones ⚠️ SWIG segfault risk, prefer IPC/UI

**Component tools:**

- `get_component_pads` - Get all pad data for a component
- `get_component_list` - List all components on the board
- `get_pad_position` - Get absolute position of a specific pad
- `place_component_array` - Place components in a grid array
- `align_components` - Align components along an axis
- `duplicate_component` - Duplicate a component with offset

### Bug Fixes

- `routing.py`: Fix SwigPyObject UUID comparison (`str()` → `m_Uuid.AsString()`)
- `routing.py`: Fix SWIG iterator invalidation after `board.Remove()` by snapshotting `list(board.Tracks())`
- `routing.py`: Add `board.SetModified()` + `track = None` after `Remove()` to prevent dangling SWIG pointer crashes
- `routing.py`: Per-track `try/except` in `query_traces()` to skip invalid objects after bulk delete
- `routing.py`: Add missing return statement (mypy)
- `library.py`: Fix `search_footprints` parameter mapping (`search_term` → `pattern`)
- `library.py`: Fix field access (`fp.name` → `fp.full_name`)
- `library.py`: Accept both `pattern` and `search_term` parameter names
- `library.py`: Fix loop variable shadowing `Path` object (mypy)
- `design_rules.py`: Add type annotation for `violation_counts` (mypy)

### New MCP Tools (cont.)

**Datasheet tools:**

- `get_datasheet_url` - Return LCSC datasheet PDF URL and product page URL for a given
  LCSC number (e.g. `C179739` → `https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/C179739.pdf`).
  No API key required – URL is constructed directly from the LCSC number.
- `enrich_datasheets` - Scan a `.kicad_sch` file and write LCSC datasheet URLs into
  every symbol that has an `LCSC` property but an empty `Datasheet` field. After
  enrichment the URL appears natively in KiCAD's symbol properties, footprint browser
  and any other tool that reads the standard KiCAD `Datasheet` field.
  Supports `dry_run=true` for preview without writing.
  Implementation: `python/commands/datasheet_manager.py` (text-based, no `skip` writes)

**Schematic tools:**

- `delete_schematic_component` - Remove a placed symbol from a `.kicad_sch` file by
  reference designator (e.g. `R1`, `U3`).

### Bug Fixes (cont.)

- `schematic.ts` / `kicad_interface.py`: Fix missing `delete_schematic_component` MCP tool.

  **Root cause (two separate issues):**
  1. No MCP tool named `delete_schematic_component` existed. Claude had no way to call
     it, so any "delete schematic component" request fell through to the PCB-only
     `delete_component` tool, which searches `pcbnew.BOARD` and always returned
     "Component not found" for schematic symbols.
  2. `component_schematic.py::remove_component()` still used `skip` for writes.
     PR #40 rewrote `DynamicSymbolLoader` (add path) to avoid `skip`-induced schematic
     corruption, but `remove_component` (delete path) was not touched by that PR.

  **Fix:**
  - Added `delete_schematic_component` to the TypeScript tool layer (`schematic.ts`)
    with clear docstring distinguishing it from the PCB `delete_component`.
  - Implemented `_handle_delete_schematic_component` in `kicad_interface.py` using
    direct text manipulation (parenthesis-depth tracking, same approach as PR #40).
    Does not call `component_schematic.py::remove_component()` at all.
  - Error message explicitly guides the user when the wrong tool is used:
    _"note: this tool removes schematic symbols, use delete_component for PCB footprints"_

### Additional Bug Fixes

- `connection_schematic.py` / `kicad_interface.py`: Fix `generate_netlist` missing
  `schematic_path` parameter – without it `get_net_connections` always fell back to
  proximity matching which only returns one connection per component (first wire hit,
  then `break`). PinLocator was never invoked. Fix: added `schematic_path: Optional[Path]`
  to `generate_netlist` signature and threaded it through to `get_net_connections`,
  and updated `_handle_generate_netlist` in `kicad_interface.py` to pass `schematic_path`.
- `server.ts`: Fix KiCAD bundled Python (3.11.5) not being selected on Windows – the
  detection condition `process.env.PYTHONPATH?.includes("KiCad")` was fragile and failed
  in some environments, causing System Python 3.12 to be used instead. Since `pcbnew.pyd`
  is compiled for KiCAD's Python 3.11.5, this resulted in `No module named 'pcbnew'`.
  Fix: removed the condition, KiCAD bundled Python is now always preferred on Windows
  when it exists at `C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\python.exe`.
  Also added `KICAD_PYTHON` to `claude_desktop_config.json` as explicit override.
- `pin_locator.py`: Fix `generate_netlist` timeout – `get_pin_location` and
  `get_all_symbol_pins` called `Schematic(schematic_path)` on every single pin lookup,
  causing O(nets × components × pins) schematic file loads (e.g. 400+ loads for a
  medium schematic). Fix: added `_schematic_cache` dict to `PinLocator.__init__`,
  schematic is now loaded once per path and reused.

### Upgrading to 2.1.0-alpha from 2.0.0-alpha

**New Dependencies:**

- No new system dependencies
- Python packages: `requests` (already in requirements.txt)

**Database Setup:**

1. Run `download_jlcpcb_database` tool (one-time, ~5-10 minutes)
2. Database created at `data/jlcpcb_parts.db`
3. Subsequent searches use local database (instant)

**API Changes:**

- All existing tools remain compatible
- 5 new JLCPCB tools available
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Upgrading to 2.0.0-alpha from 1.0.0

**Router Pattern:**

- Some tools now accessed via `execute_tool` instead of direct calls
- Use `list_tool_categories` to discover available tools
- Search with `search_tools` to find specific functionality

**IPC Backend (Optional):**

- Enable in KiCad: Preferences > Plugins > Enable IPC API Server
- Set `KICAD_BACKEND=ipc` environment variable
- Falls back to SWIG if unavailable
